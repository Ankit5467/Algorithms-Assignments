# C++-Algorithms-Assignments
 This repo contains several c++ assigments from my algorithms course (CS385)

The makefile, "makefile", is compatible with all of the files in this repo.

Summaries of the files in repo:

sieve.cpp - Implmentation of the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm which finds all of the prime numbers in a range [1,n] for all positive integral n.

stairclimber.cpp - An algorithm that displays all of the unique ways in which one can climb a certain number of stairs.

unique.cpp - An efficient algorithm that determines whether every char (a-z) in a string is unique (non-repeating).
